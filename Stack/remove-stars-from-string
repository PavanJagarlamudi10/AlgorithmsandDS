You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

Choose a star in s.
Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

// T - O(n), S - O(n) . Can use 2 pointer read and write to bring down S - O(1)
var removeStars = function(s) {
    const output = [];
    for ( let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        if(s[i] !== '*') {
            output.push(s[i]);
        }else {
            output.pop();
        }
    }
    return output.join('');
};
