You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, 
starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
 T - O(n+m) or O(n) n>m, S - O(n+m) or O(n) n>m
var mergeAlternately = function (word1, word2) {
    let merged = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < word1.length || i < word2.length; i++) {
        if (word1[i]) {
            merged += word1[i]
        }
        if (word2[i]) {
            merged += word2[i]
        }
    }
    return merged;
};

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
