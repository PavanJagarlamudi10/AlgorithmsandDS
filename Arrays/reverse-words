Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

T- O(n), S - O(n)
var reverseWords = function (s) {
    const words = s.trim().split(/\s+/);
    // return words.reverse().join(" ");
    for (let i = 0, j = words.length - 1; i<j; i++,j-- ) {
        const temp = words[i];
        words[i] = words[j];
        words[j] = temp;

    }
    return words.join(" ")

};
